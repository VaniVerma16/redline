# redline
Redline is a real-time fraud detection system that processes transactions, flags suspicious activity, and lets you track, retry, or review failuresâ€”all with queues, rules, and a live dashboard.
I am trying to implement the following features one-at-a-time:
* A system to ingest data streams in real time.
* A system to process those streams and analyze them for potential fraud.
* A system that exposes fraud analysis to people and software processes.
* A system that visualizes analytics and long-term fraud risk trends.
